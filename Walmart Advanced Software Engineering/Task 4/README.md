# Task 4: Data Munging

## Task Overview

### What you'll learn

- How to extract and manipulate data from multiple spreadsheets in Python
- How to format data to fit a specific database schema
- How to insert data into an SQLite database

### What you'll do

- Meet Keri Reynolds, the software engineering campus recruiting lead at Walmart. Keri leads the team of recruiters responsible for hiring interns and graduates into Walmart’s technical roles across the US
- Write a Python script to read rows from spreadsheets, extract relevant data, format it for the database, and insert it into the database
- Unlock the ultimate Walmart software engineering summer interview guide to help you know how to stand out in the interview process

## Task Background

Your team has been tasked with collecting metrics on a plethora of disparate shipping data. This task comes straight from the top, so it would be wise to give it your all. The data is contained in a number of different spreadsheets, each with its own competing schema. In order to interrogate the data, all of it has to be in the same place and in the same format. Currently, the shipping data exists in several places in several formats and is therefore impossible to query. To combine the spreadsheets, you need to write a python script to read through every row, extract the pertinent data, figure out how to combine it, munge it into the right format, and upload it to the database. Plenty of steps, but the resulting data will be much easier to query. Once the database contains all the data, you can pass it off to the analysis team to extract all the relevant metrics. Good luck!

## Task Details

### Part 1: Get the data

First, you need to get your hands on the relevant data. The shipping department has been kind enough to provide you with a repository containing all of their spreadsheets, as well as a copy of the sqlite database. First, fork and clone the repository at: <https://github.com/theforage/forage-walmart-task-4>

### Part 2: Populate the database

Your task is to insert all of the data contained in the provided spreadsheets into the SQLite database. You will write a Python script which:

- Reads each row from the spreadsheets.
- Extracts the relevant data.
- Munges it into a format that fits the database schema.
- Inserts the data into the database.
  Spreadsheet 0 is self contained and can simply be inserted into the database, but spreadsheets 1 and 2 are dependent on one another. Spreadsheet 1 contains a single product per row, you will need to combine each row based on its shipping identifier, determine the quantity of goods in the shipment, and add a new row to the database for each product in the shipment. The origin and destination for each shipment in spreadsheet 1 are contained in spreadsheet 2. You may assume that all the given data is valid - product names are always spelled the same way, quantities are positive, etc.

When you’re finished, convert the python script you used to populate the database into a PDF and submit it below. You'll see an example answer on the next step, but we encourage you to give it a go first!
