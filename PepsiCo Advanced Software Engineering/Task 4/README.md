# Task 4: Deliver continuously

## Task Overview

### What you'll learn

- How to develop a continuous delivery pipeline to handle deployment automatically
- The CI/CD framework and modern practices

### What you'll do

- Implement a continuous delivery pipeline for the system front end

## Task Background

Congratulations on getting the frontend for Augur up and running! Now that you’re satisfied with the dashboard, it’s time to publish it online. In this task, you’ll focus on deploying what you’ve created over the course of this program. Naturally, you’ll want to make the process as reproducible and painless as possible for you and other engineers. To that end, it would be wise to develop a continuous delivery pipeline to handle deployment automatically in a homogenized fashion. In this task, you’ll assemble a pipeline for the Augur frontend. Once finished, you’ll be ready to showcase the Augur system to its stakeholders from any browser connected to the internet.

Furthermore, a CD pipeline like the one you’ll be putting together will make any future system modification a breeze. This is the final task of the program. Once your pipeline is complete, you’ll be done with the simulation. Congratulations on making it to the end of the program, and good luck getting the Augur project across the line!

## Task Details

In this task, you must implement a continuous delivery pipeline for the Augur front end. Your pipeline must automatically build and deploy your frontend to Azure every time a commit is made to the main branch of the codebase. The CI/CD framework and Azure services you decide to use are entirely up to you. Be sure to adhere to modern CI/CD practices. The nuances of your deployment protocol are up to you, but it must be fully functional and readily comprehensible to other engineers. Your pipeline must automatically handle every step of the deployment process, from provisioning the required infrastructure on Azure to deploying the most recent codebase version. When finished, submit a link to your codebase in the next step, complete with CI/CD config files.
