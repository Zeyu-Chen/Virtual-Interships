# Task 3: Develop a frontend

## Task Overview

### What you'll learn

- How to split system development work into frontend and backend

### What you'll do

- Create a single-page application that displays a series of metrics for each distributor in the system

### Task Background

It’s important to have a demo for this project as soon as possible so you have something to showcase when the time comes. Since the frontend is significantly more interesting than the backend to a non-technical audience, that’s where you should focus your efforts. You can populate the dashboard with mock data while you wait on the backend, then circle back and integrate it when everything’s ready. The first sprint for the Augur project has begun, and all of the engineers on your team have started work on the tickets you assigned them—they’ll begin work on the backend while you cobble together a frontend.

### Task Details

Your task is to scaffold the frontend of the Augur system. You must create a single-page application that displays a series of metrics for each distributor in the system. Eventually, your frontend will integrate with the backend your team is building, but for now, simply populate it with mock data. Your dashboard should display the following information for each distributor:

- Name.
- Quantity of goods shipped last month.
- Forecasted quantity of goods to ship this coming month.
- Year-to-date average goods shipped per month.

Additionally, use your best judgment to determine what other information to surface on the page, given what you know about the Augur system. This task aims to ensure that you are comfortable kicking off a project like this with little guidance. The choice of framework, language, etc., is entirely up to you. (Note: you should use modern tooling and practices.) Furthermore, you must develop an engaging, aesthetically pleasing user interface. Take some time to polish your website and prepare it for demonstration. Remember that the frontend is the first part of Augur that stakeholders will see, so it’s imperative that it makes a good impression. When you finish, push your codebase to a public Git repo and submit a link in the next step. Good luck!
