# Augur Engineering Tickets

## Epic: Frontend Development

### User Story 1

As a PepsiCo distributor, I want to see a dashboard with key metrics so that I can quickly assess my distribution performance.

Tasks:

1. Set up React.js project structure
2. Implement responsive layout using React components
3. Create reusable chart components using D3.js
4. Implement authentication and user session management

### User Story 2

As a user, I want to view detailed information about each metric so that I can understand the data better.

Tasks:

1. Design and implement detailed view components for each metric
2. Create modal or expandable sections for metric details
3. Implement data fetching from backend API for detailed views

## Epic: Backend Development

### User Story 3

As a system administrator, I want the backend to process and store data from the external predictive shipping pipeline so that it can be used for analysis and display.

Tasks:

1. Set up Azure Functions for data processing
2. Implement data ingestion from Azure Service Bus
3. Design and implement database schema for storing processed data
4. Create data transformation and aggregation functions

### User Story 4

As a developer, I want to create RESTful API endpoints so that the frontend can retrieve necessary data.

Tasks:

1. Set up API Gateway using Azure API Management
2. Implement CRUD operations for distributor data
3. Create endpoints for retrieving aggregated metrics
4. Implement caching mechanism for frequently accessed data

## Epic: Data Processing and Analytics

### User Story 5

As a business analyst, I want the system to calculate key metrics automatically so that I can focus on analysis rather than data preparation.

Tasks:

1. Implement calculation for year-to-date average quantity of goods shipped
2. Create function to determine last month's shipment quantity
3. Develop forecasting algorithm for next month's shipment quantity
4. Implement error handling and data validation for calculations

## Epic: Integration and Deployment

### User Story 6

As a DevOps engineer, I want to set up a CI/CD pipeline so that we can deploy updates efficiently and reliably.

Tasks:

1. Set up Azure DevOps for the project
2. Configure build pipelines for frontend and backend
3. Implement automated testing in the CI pipeline
4. Set up staging and production environments in Azure

### User Story 7

As a system architect, I want to ensure all components are properly integrated so that the system functions as a cohesive unit.

Tasks:

1. Configure Azure Service Bus for message passing between components
2. Set up Azure Monitor for system-wide logging and monitoring
3. Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for inter-service communication
4. Conduct end-to-end integration testing

## Epic: Security and Compliance

### User Story 8

As a security officer, I want to ensure the system adheres to PepsiCo's security standards so that we protect sensitive business data.

Tasks:

1. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for the system
2. Set up encryption for data at rest and in transit
3. Conduct security audit and penetration testing
4. Implement secure API authentication mechanism

Note: This is an initial set of tickets and may need to be expanded or refined as the project progresses. Each epic and user story should be prioritized and assigned to specific team members or roles during sprint planning.

### User Story 9

As a distributor, I want to see my year-to-date average quantity of goods shipped so that I can understand my overall performance.

Tasks:

1. Create a component to display the year-to-date average
2. Implement API call to fetch the required data
3. Add data visualization (e.g., trend line chart) for this metric
4. Implement user interface for selecting different time ranges (e.g., last 3 months, 6 months, 1 year)

### User Story 10

As a distributor, I want to view the quantity of goods shipped last month and the forecasted quantity for this month side by side so that I can compare and plan accordingly.

Tasks:

1. Design and implement a comparative view component
2. Create API endpoints for fetching last month's data and this month's forecast
3. Implement data fetching and state management for these metrics
4. Add visual indicators (e.g., up/down arrows) to show the trend

## Additional Notes

- For the Data Processing Service (User Story 3, Task 1), consider using Azure Functions with a timer trigger for regular data processing, and an event trigger for real-time updates.
- When implementing the forecasting algorithm (User Story 5, Task 3), start with a simple moving average model and plan for future enhancements using more sophisticated methods like ARIMA or machine learning models.
- For the CI/CD pipeline (User Story 6), ensure that you implement feature flags to enable easier rollback and A/B testing of new features.
