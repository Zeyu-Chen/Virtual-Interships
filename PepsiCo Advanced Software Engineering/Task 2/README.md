# Task 2: Delegate tasks

## Task Overview

### What you'll learn

- How to divide the work to create the system into granular tasks
- How to articulate these tasks clearly to an engineering team

### What you'll do

- Develop a collection of engineering tickets that fully capture the work required to implement the system

## Task Background

Now that you have a concrete design for your system, it’s time to divide the work into granular tasks. For your team to build a successful system, everyone working on it must have a clear idea of what they should be doing. As a team lead, it’s your responsibility to delegate work to each team member. At PepsiCo, work is articulated through engineering tickets in an Agile workflow. To succeed in this position, you must be proficient in splitting a large project into smaller tasks that can be completed simultaneously. For this task, you will devise a plan for the development of Augur. This plan will be expressed through a series of engineering tickets drafted for your co-workers. Once you finish this step, you’ll have everything you need to kick off the Augur project’s first sprint. Then, the development of the system can begin in earnest. Good luck!

## Task Details

Using the design from the previous task, develop a collection of engineering tickets that fully capture the work required to implement the system. The format of the tickets is up to you—user stories or use cases, Kanban or scrum, it doesn’t matter. Use whatever format you are most familiar with. The goal here is to prove you can articulate a system in words, just as you did with a diagram in the previous task. Be concise, but don’t leave out any crucial information; other engineers should be able to make sense of your tickets with little effort. As you come up with your tickets, add them to a board on Trello or similar. By the time you finish, your board should be ready to kick off the first sprint for Augur. When you have completed the task, submit a link to your board in the next step.
